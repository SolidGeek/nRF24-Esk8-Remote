# nRF24-Esk8-Remote

Control your electric skateboard an Arduino controlled remote. This repository contains the needed software for the remote and the receiver, however you will need to install a few Arduino Libraries in order to compile the Arduino sketches. The Arduino IDE comes with most of the needed libraries, but you will ned to manually install VescUartControl from RollingGecko: https://github.com/RollingGecko/VescUartControl.

You can find the 3D-models for the remote (STL files) on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2454391 and read more about the project on: https://www.electric-skateboard.builders/t/simple-3d-printed-nrf-remote-arduino-controlled/28543

I have made a Wiki here on Github, with a few tips and guides on how to build the remote. The Wiki can be found here: https://github.com/MrSolidGeek/nRF24-Esk8-Remote/wiki
